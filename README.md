# Marble Solitaire Game

This is an implementation of a marble solitaire game developed for CS3500 - Object Oriented Design at Northeastern University in Summer of 2022. This project was done individually by me and came with starter code provided by the professors of the course. This application was developed in Intellij IDEA and utilizes the MVC pattern for the overall structure and design of the program. This program can be ran in a terminal window and can be played with 3 different shaped boards.

Note that there is an unconventional use of a custom exception that I created while developing this program. This poor design decision should be fixed eventually.

## Tech Stack

This app was created using

- Java (Java 11+)
- JUnit (JUnit4)
